# datalog

A simple, unoptimized, purely functional Datalog implementation, inspired by miniKanren.

Includes naive, semi-naive, and backward-chaining implementations.

This implementation was originally created to accompany a presentation I gave about Datalog at the Clojure PDX meetup on March 1st, 2018. The slides from that presentation are in the doc directory [here](./doc/datalog-presentation.org).

Feedback welcome!

## Syntax

### Facts (atoms)
Entity-Attribute-Value (EAV) triples.

Example:
```clojure
[Zeus :father Cronus]
```
### Variables (lvars)
Symbols that start with a '?'.

Example:
```clojure
?x
```

### Rules
Vectors of atoms. The first element is the head of the rule and the rest are the body.

Example:
```clojure
[[?x :grandparent ?y] [?x :parent ?z] [?z :parent ?y]]
```
"x has grandparent y, if x has parent z, and z has parent y."
